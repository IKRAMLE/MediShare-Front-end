In other words, caregivers offer comprehensive and continuous care, while attendant services may focus on specific tasks or nursing care specializations."},{question:"What are the roles and responsibilities of a patient attendant?",answer:"The responsibilities of a patient attendant (at home) usually involve delivering care and support to patients in a healthcare setting. This can entail assisting with activities of daily living like bathing, dressing, grooming, feeding, and toileting while following care plans provided by healthcare professionals to ensure the patient's well-being.<br/><br/> Patient attendants (including a female or male attendant for elderly) may also assist with patient mobility, turning and repositioning, monitoring vital signs, providing companionship, and reporting any changes in the patient's condition to the healthcare team. Their responsibilities may also include maintaining a clean and safe environment for the patient, providing emotional support, and following care plans as directed by healthcare professionals."},{question:"What is the Cost of Home Attendant Services?",answer:"The cost of home attendant services can vary depending on several factors, such as the location, duration of services, level of care needed, and specific services provided.

This can include situations where individuals have limited mobility, are recovering from surgery or illness, have chronic health conditions, or need extra support due to aging or disability.<br/><br/> In-home patient attendant services can also provide companionship and emotional support to homebound individuals or those in need of social interaction. However, the specific reasons for needing in-home patient attendant services can vary depending on the unique circumstances and requirements of the individual."},{question:"What tasks do our in-home patient attendants do?",answer:"Our certified caregivers and in-home patient attendants offer comprehensive care, which encompasses mobility assistance, hygiene maintenance, feeding, exercise support, and specialized <a href='/nursing-services/' style='text-decoration: underline'>nursing care</a>. <br/><br/>Our services cover a wide range of tasks, including oral hygiene and bed bathing (or sponge bathing), keeping the patient's room clean, providing feeding and bathroom assistance, assisting with walking and home exercise, turning bedridden patients, offering companionship and polite conversations, and a lot more."},{question:"How do you maintain the quality of your attendant services?",answer:"At our company, we firmly believe that quality assurance is the backbone of our attendant services.

The second step involves Police verification to check if there have been any past law enforcement issues associated with the individual.
