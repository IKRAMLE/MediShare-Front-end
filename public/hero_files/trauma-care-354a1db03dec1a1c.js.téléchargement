Factors such as location, staff qualifications, and treatment modalities should be considered. When visiting a center, it's essential to ask pertinent questions about their approach to nursing care of trauma patients and trauma care nursing in general. Patient testimonials and reviews can also provide valuable insights into the quality of care provided.<br/><br/>\n      Trauma can be debilitating, but with the right care, recovery is attainable. Post hospital trauma care centers play a pivotal role in this journey, offering specialized treatments for conditions like PTSD. PTSD treatment, PTSD management, and PTSD recovery are integral components of the healing process. Prioritizing mental health and well-being is essential, and seeking help from a reputed trauma care center is a step in the right direction.\n      </p>"},]},$=[{video:"https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/cdn-cas.hcah.in/app/tcc/Testimonital+Anshika+Srivastva.mp4",image:"/media/ratingAndLeads/tcc_feedback_video_1.webp"},{video:"https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/cdn-cas.hcah.in/app/tcc/Testimonital+Anil+Agarwal.mp4",image:"/media/ratingAndLeads/tcc_feedback_video_2.webp"},],_=a(90542),C=r()(function(){return Promise.all([a.e(1216),a.e(41664),a.e(61608),a.e(85518),a.e(77733),a.e(32835)]).then(a.bind(a,77733))},{loadableGenerated:{webpack:function(){return[77733]}}}),T=r()(function(){return Promise.all([a.e(1216),a.e(41664),a.e(61608),a.e(85518),a.e(1941)]).then(a.bind(a,1941))},{loadableGenerated:{webpack:function(){return[1941]}}}),x=r()(function(){return Promise.all([a.e(1216),a.e(41664),a.e(61608),a.e(85518),a.e(94811)]).then(a.bind(a,94811))},{loadableGenerated:{webpack:function(){return[94811]}}}),k=r()(function(){return Promise.all([a.e(1216),a.e(61608),a.e(22004),a.e(21039)]).then(a.bind(a,21039))},{loadableGenerated:{webpack:function(){return[21039]}}}),j=r()(function(){return Promise.all([a.e(1216),a.e(61608),a.e(44329)]).then(a.bind(a,44329))},{loadableGenerated:{webpack:function(){return[44329]}}}),H=r()(function(){return Promise.all([a.e(1216),a.e(61608),a.e(29798)]).then(a.bind(a,29798))},{loadableGenerated:{webpack:function(){return[29798]}}}),D=r()(function(){return Promise.all([a.e(1216),a.e(41664),a.e(61608),a.e(85518),a.e(86529),a.e(22004),a.e(11016),a.e(77295)]).then(a.bind(a,11016))},{loadableGenerated:{webpack:function(){return[11016]}}}),P=r()(function(){return Promise.all([a.e(1216),a.e(61608),a.e(66851)]).then(a.bind(a,60899))},{loadableGenerated:{webpack:function(){return[60899]}}}),S=r()(function(){return a.e(96623).then(a.bind(a,96623))},{loadableGenerated:{webpack:function(){return[96623]}}}),A=r()(function(){return Promise.all([a.e(41664),a.e(61608),a.e(20004)]).then(a.bind(a,20004))},{loadableGenerated:{webpack:function(){return[20004]}}}),B=r()(function(){return Promise.all([a.e(1216),a.e(41664),a.e(61608),a.e(5884),a.e(97226)]).then(a.bind(a,5884))},{loadableGenerated:{webpack:function(){return[5884]}}}),I=r()(function(){return Promise.all([a.e(1216),a.e(61608),a.e(85518),a.e(80588)]).then(a.bind(a,80588))},{loadableGenerated:{webpack:function(){return[80588]}}}),M=r()(function(){return Promise.all([a.e(1216),a.e(61608),a.e(99196)]).then(a.bind(a,99196))},{loadableGenerated:{webpack:function(){return[99196]}}}),R=r()(function(){return Promise.all([a.e(41664),a.e(61608),a.e(85518),a.e(14449)]).then(a.bind(a,14449))},{loadableGenerated:{webpack:function(){return[14449]}}}),E=r()(function(){return Promise.all([a.e(1216),a.e(41664),a.e(61608),a.e(85518),a.e(34856),a.e(35137)]).then(a.bind(a,58424))},{loadableGenerated:{webpack:function(){return[58424]}},ssr:!1}),G=!0,W=function(e){return(0,i.jsxs)("section",{children:[(0,i.jsx)(C,{}),(0,i.jsx)(u,{faqList:f}),(0,i.jsx)(T,{heading:"Recover from Brain Injury",subheading:"Early rehabilitation is critical for returning to normal life",bgImageDesktop:"/media/homepageBanner/traumaCareHomepageBanner.webp",formHeading:"Book an online consult with our expert",breadcrumbLink:"Trauma Care",defaultFormValue:"Transition Care",breadcrumbUrl:"Trauma Care",backgroundImageSize:"caregiver",displayValue:"Trauma Care",bgImageMobile:"/media/homepageBanner/traumaCareHomepageBannerMobile.webp",minheight:"258px",tccCity:!0,imageAltText:"Trauma Recovery - HCAH"}),(0,i.jsx)(x,{title:h.title,description:h.description,cardData:h.cardData,additionalFeatures:h.additionalFeatures}),(0,i.jsx)(k,{content:g,callbackButton:!0,video:!0}),(0,i.jsx)(I,{HealthInsuranceData:e,pageName:"Trauma Care"}),(0,i.jsx)(M,{serviceGuideData:v}),(0,i.jsx)(j,{desktopItems:4,sliderData:y,sliderHeading:"Meet Our Experts",sliderSubheadingDesktop:"With you, at every step of the way",sliderSubheadingMobile:"With you, at every step of the way",cardTitle:"cardTitleLarge",cardText:"cardTextMedium",footerDescription:"<h3 class='footerDescription lexend-deca'>Multidisciplinary team of <span class='lexend-deca' style='color:#f79333 !important'>900+ specialists </span>including doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, dieticians & psychologists.</h3>",isRoute:!0}),(0,i.jsx)(H,{contacts:_.w}),(0,i.jsx)(D,{cards:!0,ratingAndLeadsCardData:p,ratingAndLeadsSectionInfoData:b,showVideo:!0,ratingAndLeadsVideoData:$}),(0,i.jsx)(R,{whatWeOfferData:w}),(0,i.jsx)(P,{list:f}),(0,i.jsx)(E,{categoryId:13,alternativeTitle:"Related Blog Posts"}),(0,i.jsx)(S,{FeaturedPostsData:m}),(0,i.jsx)(A,{appButtonTitle:"For pain free life",appButtonText:"Request a call back"}),(0,i.jsx)(B,{})]})}},90542:function(e,t,a){"use strict";a.d(t,{v:function(){return n},w:function(){return i}});var i={heading:"Have a question?
