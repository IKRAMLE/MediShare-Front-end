patient with compromised airways to breathe and manage secretions through the neck instead of the mouth and nose. The procedure can be done as an emergency or elective procedure, depending on the patient's condition and indication for surgery.<br/><br/> In an emergency situation, the procedure is often done to relieve airway obstruction due to trauma, infection, or other conditions. On the other hand, in elective tracheostomy, the procedure is performed to facilitate long-term ventilatory support in patients with chronic respiratory failure or those who need prolonged intubation. During tracheostomy an opening (stoma) is created in front of the neck and into the trachea or windpipe. This surgical intervention can be performed for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.<br/><br/>\n            Tracheostomy is an invasive procedure that requires careful assessment of the patient's airway and meticulous surgical technique to avoid potential complications such as bleeding, infection, or injury to nearby structures. Therefore, tracheostomy care nursing and tracheostomy tube care are critical in preventing and managing potential complications. Tracheostomy suctioning steps should also be followed to maintain airway patency and manage secretions effectively.
